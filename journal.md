08/29/25 - Subject: Github, In todays class we talked about linking our github's. To do this we use ssh keys. How it works is you and
github both have a public and private key. To be alble to trust eachother github sends an encrypted file that uses your public key. You then have to decrypt it with your private key to show the server that you are who you say you are. This is how ssh keys work.

09/3/25 - I faced an issue with ssh keys. I was able to clone, but not able to push commits to the online repo. The solution was to  make a new set of ssh keys in ubuntu instead of visual studios. Adding the new ssh key allowed me to push, commit, etc.
